## Exercise I

a) considering that there is no nested loops, and the operation will excute n time regardless of the input size,
the runtime is O(n).


b) Since the outer loop contains a loop, the operation will complete once the inner stops as well as the outer loop, so 
the runtime is O(N^2). 


c) Since this function contains the use of recursion, the process will repeat until
the base case is met, which means the run time is O(n)  

## Exercise II


To minimize the result of broken eggs, I would drop the egg from the building(lowest) to building(highest), so that 
I can find which floor breaks the egg. If this method were to be implemented, the time
complexity will be O(n)
